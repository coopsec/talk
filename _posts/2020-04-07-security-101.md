## Fundamental Information Security Domains

The domains below represent (generally) foundational knowledge areas for infosec professionals. You certainly do not need to be an expert in each of the security disciplines, but knowing as much as you can in each will ensure you are well-rounded information security generalist.

* __Security Fundamentals__ (e.g confidentiality/integrity/availability, risk management, least privilege, access control, defense-in-depth, etc...)
* __Scripting/Programming__ (e.g. Python, Ruby, Powershell, Bash, Java, C, C#, etc...)
* __OS Fundamentals__ (e.g. Linux, Windows, MacOS etc...)
* __Networking__ (e.g. TCP/IP, Networking Protocols, Routing/Switching, etc...)
* __Web Applications__ (e.g. HTTP, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, REST, SQL, etc...)

## Resources
Learning to [Google](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) for things is probably the most valuable piece of advise for better understanding OSINT.

### Where to Learn Stuff
There are plenty of online training/learning sites. Below are some of my favorites. Check out [this post](https://coopsec.github.io/blog/General-Security/) for a more comprehensive list!

* [Awesome Free Training List](https://github.com/gerryguy311/CyberProfDevelopmentCovidResources/blob/master/README.md) - This individual has been maintaining a pretty fantastic list of free resources, everything from training to podcasts.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - Can't figure something out, stack's got your back.

### Stay Up To Date
Infosec is a fast-moving field. Keeping up to date on everything going on is a large part of being a successful infosec practitioner. The resources below can help you keep track of it all...


To get you started, here is a [curated list of feeds] I follow (subreddits, blogs and twitter accounts). I try to keep it up to date.

### OS Fundamentals
You're likely going to be using one or more OS'es to secure the same or other OS'es. In other words, you should probably learn about OS stuff.

* [Windows Tutorials](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/windowsbasics/all-about-windows/1/) - Learn about Windows
* [Windows Active Directory Tutorials](https://www.active-directory-security.com/) - Learn about Windows AD and it's security

* [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org) - Download Kali, learn security tools, learn Linux.
* [SS64 Command Line References](https://ss64.com) - Assorted command line references.

### Networking
Packets. Segments. Datagrams. Data. It moves from place to place and knowing how that happens is pretty useful.

* [Nmap](https://nmap.org) - Available in the Kali distribution - Learn network scanning and a little TCP/IP while you're at it!

### Web Applications
The [Internet](https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/). Ever heard of it? It's full of web apps!

* [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) - First stop for all things web-app security.

## Conclusion
Thanks for reading! I hope the guide was useful in some way. I'd also like to reiterate that this is by no means an exhaustive how-to, nor does it represent the best or clearest path to a successful career in infosec. I only hope it can act as a compass for those who are interested.
