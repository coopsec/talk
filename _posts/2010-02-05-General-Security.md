1. __Certifications__. In my experience - recruiters, hiring managers, other infosec pros (to some degree) and the infosec industry at large __love__ certifications. Take for example, the CompTIA [Security+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security) certification. The Securtiy+ is a great entry-level cert which can not only demonstrate that you are serious about getting into infosec but it also is a great introduction to a lot of the foundational infosec concepts you will need throughout your career. I think the return on investment in getting this cert is well worth it (I in-fact started out my infosec career with this cert so I can attest to its worthiness to some degree.) As you learn more (and with time/budget willing), begin to take a look at some [other certification options](#certifications) as well.

### Certifications
Certs. Love 'em or hate 'em, they can be helpful.

* [CompTIA Security+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security) - Entry level certification but provides invaluable entry-level knowledge to the field of infosec.
* [SANS](https://www.sans.org) - Fantastic cybersecurity training but very expensive.
* [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/) - Practical penetration testing training (and highly regarded certification in the industry).
* [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) - Need to improve resume? This cert can often help.
* [eLearnSecurity](https://www.elearnsecurity.com) - Practical, hands-on infosec training. They have a great catalog of courses.
